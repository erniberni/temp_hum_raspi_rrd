Summary: Everything you need to build a 868 MHz wireless sensor network with collecting data in rrd databases and presenting graphical results 

1. A sensor based on TinyTX (http://nathan.chantrell.net/tinytx-wireless-sensor/) sends data on 868 MHz with RFM12B. The sensor in use is a DHT22 and the processor is a ATTiny84. The software of Nathan Chantrell's TinyTX was modified slightly to send also informations on uptime. For more information on the TinyTX visit the above mentioned webpage.
